If a function's behavior and signature are identical in all derived classes, then abstract the function into the base class.  Remove it from all derived classes.

float function(int par1, float par2, char par3); <<<---signature

If a function's signature is identical in all derived classes, but the behavior
is different, then abstract up the signature and put the word "virtual" in
front of it. Each derived class will write their own version of the function.
