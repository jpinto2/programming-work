See nov 16 for how to incorporate a function into a priority queue

//approximation for distance remaining
//I'll provide this
int distance_between_hexes(unsigned int starthex, unsigned int endhex)

//This function is what is passed to the priority queue when it is
created. Note, therefore, that est_tot_dist is a global variable:
std::vector<unsigned int> est_tot_dist;
bool which_is_closer(unsigned int a, unsigned int b)
{
  return est_total_dist[a] > est_tot_dist[b]
}
