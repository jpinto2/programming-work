1. Pick the sorting class you are most comfortable with. Start writing Sort.cpp using Sort.h as a guide. Functions which are identical between the different Sorting classes should be removed and put inside of the base class.

Functions in Heapsort:
	add //Move into base
  sort
	display //Move into base
	internal_sort //private
	right //private
	left //private
