The parameter to this Person's grab function is a weapon pointer "wp"

if(nothing in right hand && right hand strength >= strength reqd)
     put weapon in right hand.  That is:
     rhw=wp;

 else if(nothing in left hand && left hand strength >= strength reqd)
     put weapon in left hand.  That is:
     lhw=wp;
 else
  if(nothing in left and nothing in right and lhstrength+rhstrength >= strength reqd)

a little logic to return true or false depending whether wp has been assigned to rhw and/or lhw
