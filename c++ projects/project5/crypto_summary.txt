You will write two programs: encode & decode
Every program you have written this semester has required a main-function.
Therefore in this project you will turn in 2 main-functions.
1) encode takes text (can take many lines) from cin
   encode spits out a code (that is, a sequence of numbers) to cout

2) decode takes a code (that is, a sequence of numbers) from cin
   decode spits out text (can spit out many lines) to cout

There is a rotors.txt file. This file is not something you turn in, it is something that is created and shared between the spies.

int main()
{
  CryptMachine cm("rotors.txt");
}

if(a==5)
{
  float b;
  ....
}

CryptoMachine::CryptoMachine(string fname)
{
   vector<Rotor> spindle; //wrong
   ifstream inf( fname.c_str() );
   //read in pairs of numbers form inf and put them into spindle
   //close file
}
